Welcome to Keep On Running!

This is part of a project that I (DanilsDoes aka Daniel Hollowell) am working on where I make a game a week and put it on the internet for people to see! My hope with this is that I learn what I really enjoy doing in Game Development and if this is something I can see myself doing longterm as my fulltime job in a studio or individually.

Keep On Running!
    Keep on running is a different type of endless runner where you are trying to outrun the storm and you survive as long as you can fighting enemies and getting powerups along the way.

General Idea
    You run to the right and there is lots of gold to collect, enemies to fight. Generally there is a fair bit of stuff to collect but there is also a big blue storm chasing you causing you to need to prioritize things and leave other things behind. As you get further ahead of the storm you will have more time to collect stuff in specific areas. If you are not fast enough and caught in the storm you slowly will lose life until you lose all your HP and die. Survive as long as you can and then try to get further the next run!
